1. We would fit our automated tests in our Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This allows us to execute tests automatically and independently once we make any changes. It offers the advantages of early detection, speed, consistency, and collaboration.
2. No, checking if a singular function is returning the correct output should be a unit test instead of E2E testing.
3. No, this feature could require many more than one unit test to fully test its functionality.
4. Yes, because this feature probably won't affect other features.
